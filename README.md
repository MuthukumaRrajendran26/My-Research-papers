An Interactive topic model of Reddit data to uncover how covid-19 affects mental health:
========================================================================================

Abstract:
=========
Social media is the main online means of interaction among individuals during this COVID-19 pandemic situation. People are increasingly using social media, especially online communities, to discuss health concerns and seek support. Understanding topics, sentiment, and structures of these communities informs important aspects of health-related conditions. There has been growing research interest in analysing online mental health communities; however, analysis of these communities with health concerns has been limited. This paper investigates and identifies latent meta-groups of online communities with mental health-related conditions including depression and anxiety. Large datasets from online communities were crawled. We analyse topic-based features from posts made by members of these online communities. The work focuses on using LDA as the topic modelling approach to infer latent topics automatically from the corpus. The visualization of the discovered communities or topics is visualized by a visual library called pyLDAvis. This presents evidence of various topics in online mental health-related.


Generating Short Description of Videos:
=======================================

Abstract:
=========

Generating short description of videosâ€™ is an academic project in which various extractive text summarization methodologies are used to generate a short description of videos. In this project, Sentence embedding and word embedding techniques such as TF-IDF, Glove/Fasttext, Skip thought vectors, and Universal sentence encoder is used. Along with these embedding techniques, K-means clustering, Smooth inverse frequency, and Page ranking are used to generate an extractive summary of the videos. Additionally, ROGUE metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the generated summaries with the golden summaries. Based on the results observed, Universal sentence encoder outperformed other summarization techniques.


Interactive meta-cluster detection in Twitter data:
===================================================

Abstract:
=========

Social media has been the main online mean of interaction among individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. People are increasingly using social media, especially online communities, to discuss health concerns and seek for support. Understanding topics, sentiment and structure of these communities could potentially reveal important aspects of health-related conditions or psychological or sociological trends. In this project, we investigate and identify latent meta-groups of topics and trends with mental health-related conditions including depression and anxiety, using a large dataset extracted from Twitter. To understand the data, we performed Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques on the sentence embeddings obtained using Deep Language Models, and then we analysed the topic based features present in the posts made by members in those clusters. The work focuses on providing tools to cluster and interpret the sentence embeddings provided by the Language Models using classical Machine Learning and Natural Language methods. We also propose the use of a type of Graph and some basic Community detection algorithms inside an interactive tool to involve the user in the process of topic discovery.
